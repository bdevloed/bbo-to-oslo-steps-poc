PoC exploring the feasibility of an automated BBO to OSLO-Steps mapping

## Context

Investigating the feasibility generating OSLO steps starting from BPMN.

The goal is not to provide a fully working solution, rather understand

- how far this could be automated
- what has to be taken into account when creating BPMNs in order to have a working BPMN -> OSLO steps solution.
- what extra information is needed next to BPMN and mappings to create OSLO-Steps.

A bit more context on BPMN and BBO can be found in the [bpmn_bbo_mapping](https://github.com/MartijnBogaert/bpmn_bbo_mapping) repo.

## Implementation

### BPMN to linked data

[bpmn_bbo_mapping](https://github.com/MartijnBogaert/bpmn_bbo_mapping) maps BPMN (xml) to linked expressed using the BBO and BBO-ext ontologies.

### BBO to OSLO-Steps

This repo maps the data (partially) to OSLO steps.

The mapping rules and queries are written in [Notation3](https://w3c.github.io/N3/spec/) and can be executed using the (EYE Reasoner)[https://github.com/eyereasoner/eye].

In a nutshell:

- Flow elements are States in OSLO Steps
  - Naming Step: concatenation of upstream activity/gateway name + flow annotation.
- Activities are Steps in OSLO Steps
- State shapes are out of scope of the mapping

## Run the code

The easiest way is using the `playground/playground.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

Below are instructions to execute the steps using eye directly with `input.nq` being the bpmn data generated by [bpmn_bbo_mapping](https://github.com/MartijnBogaert/bpmn_bbo_mapping)

### EYE native

```
eye --nope --quiet --pass input.nq https://www.irit.fr/recherches/MELODI/ontologies/BBO/ontology.ttl bbo-to-oslo-steps.n3 > oslo-steps.ttl
```

### Docker on Linux/OSX

```
docker run --net=host --rm -v $HOME:$HOME -w $(pwd) -ti eyereasoner/eye --nope --quiet --pass input.nq https://www.irit.fr/recherches/MELODI/ontologies/BBO/ontology.ttl bbo-to-oslo-steps.n3 > oslo-steps.ttl

```
